strCrewOverflowDescription="Onboard the Avenger, space is precious and currently we are holding more people that we can safely support. There are fewer racks than there are people, and some of our soldiers are sleeping on the floor. Morale is taking a hit and will recovery times are greater as a result. To resolve this situation, we should consider upgrading the Living Quarters (the room below the Commander's Quarters) to increase the Crew Limit or dismissing some non-essential personnel to lower our crew count."
